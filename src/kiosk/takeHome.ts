// =====================================================================
// "Take it with you" — the URL behind the kiosk QR pill
// =====================================================================
// This is the Dome-to-Phone handoff: a guest points their camera at the pill
// and their phone opens the app showing EXACTLY the channel and view they were
// looking at on the lobby screen. Three things follow from "it has to work on
// a phone, off the museum's network, weeks later":
//
//   1. The base URL is `kioskHomeUrl` (set in main.ts) whenever it's set. The
//      exhibit machine's own address is usually localhost or a LAN IP, which
//      no guest's phone can reach; deriving from window.location is only a
//      development fallback.
//   2. The kiosk-only params never travel. A guest's phone must not boot into
//      kiosk mode, and ?kioskIdle / ?kioskStats / ?debug mean nothing off the
//      exhibit floor.
//   3. The deep-link params are stripped and then re-added from live state, so
//      the QR encodes what is on screen RIGHT NOW — not whatever the URL says
//      (useDeepLink writes it back on a 300 ms debounce, and during the attract
//      loop it reflects the loop, not the guest).
