// =====================================================================
// Touch gestures — pinch to zoom, twist to rotate, one finger to orbit
// =====================================================================
// This module OWNS touch input for the stage. The engine's own two-finger
// handling is switched off in wwt-hacks.ts, and the reason is not that it is
// badly written but that it is structurally wrong for this app. Four
// independent faults, all read from the engine source (@wwtelescope/engine
// index.js) and all sufficient on their own to make pinch feel broken:
//
//   1. TWO COMPETING IMPLEMENTATIONS. `WWTControl.setup` binds `touchstart/
//      move/end` AND `pointerdown/move/up` to the same canvas (~68648-68663),
//      and both call `zoom()` — `onTouchMove` at ~68206 and `onPointerMove` at
//      ~68350. Every modern touch browser fires both families for one finger,
//      so a pinch applied roughly the SQUARE of the intended ratio. Worse, the
//      two paths have different gates: the pointer path zooms from the first
//      move, the touch path waits for `_twoTouchEvents > 10` (~67062, ~68185).
//      The gain therefore CHANGES mid-gesture — slow, then abruptly ~2x
//      faster, which is exactly the "unreliable" signature.
//   2. `_rotating` LATCHES. `onTouchMove` only zooms when
//      `radialMagnitude > angularMagnitude && !this._rotating` (~68202). Two
//      thumbs converging are almost never purely radial, so the first frames
//      often read as rotation, `_rotating` goes true (~68224) and the zoom
//      branch is blocked for the REST of the gesture — cleared only in
//      `onTouchEnd`. And because the engine's `roll()` did nothing in this app,
//      the branch that won produced no visible motion at all.
//   3. `_dragging` LATCHES TOO. The two-finger block is gated on
//      `!this._dragging` (~68184), which goes true after 8 px of one-finger
//      drag (~68244) and is cleared at ~68285 — which `onTouchEnd` SKIPS via an
//      early return when two touches were involved (~68274). So "drag the Sun,
//      then add a second finger to zoom" never zoomed.
//   4. `targetTouches`. Two-finger mode is decided by
//      `ev.targetTouches.length === 2` (~68153), and `targetTouches` only holds
//      touches whose target is the canvas. Touch events do not bubble from a
//      sibling overlay, so a finger landing on ANY `pointer-events: auto`
//      element never reached the engine and the pinch silently degraded to an
//      orbit. The offenders sit right on the disk: the 44 px region and
//      spacecraft chips.
//
// Fault 4 is the user's actual complaint — "we need to be able to pinch zoom
// anywhere on the screen that is not a layer overlay" — and it is why this
// module listens on the STAGE ROOT in the CAPTURE phase rather than on the
// canvas. Capture runs ancestor-first, so a second finger landing on a label
// chip is seen here before the chip sees it.
//
// What is NOT the problem, so nobody "fixes" it again: `preventDefault` is not
// missing. The engine preventDefaults touchstart, both touchmove branches,
// touchend, pointermove and wheel; its listeners are non-passive because they
// are bound to the canvas; `touch-action: none` is set on
// `.wwtelescope-component`; and `main.ts` preventDefaults document
// `gesturestart`. Browser page-zoom is not stealing the gesture.
